# Music Visualiser Project

Name: Yuhong He

# Description of the assignment

This assignment is about music visualisation. I created 4 themes that responds to music.

# Instructions

## Control

My assignment could be controlled with both keyboard and mouse. Keyboard SPACE controls the music start or pause. This could also control with the mouse click. In the menu area, I drawed a start/pause and a rewind button, and 4 buttons for every theme. Rewind and theme choose can only control by mouse click.

This is code:

```Java
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```

So is this without specifying the language:

```
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```
